# React Tweets

React Tweets is a web application built using Vite, a fast build tool for React projects. It allows users to create and view tweets in a single-page application. The application is connected to a dummy backend made in Express, which provides the necessary data for displaying posts.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 12 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

To set up and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd react-tweets
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

To retrieve and display posts from the dummy backend, you need to start the Express server. In a separate terminal, navigate to the `dummy-backend` directory:

```
cd dummy-backend
```

Start the server:

```
node server.js
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` and provide the necessary API endpoints for fetching posts.

## Project Structure

```

## Customization

Feel free to customize the application according to your needs. Here are a few suggestions:

- Modify the `Tweet` component in the `components/` directory to change the appearance or add additional fields to each tweet.
- Implement additional API endpoints in the Express server to support features such as posting new tweets or user authentication.
- Connect the application to a real backend server or a database for persistent data storage.
